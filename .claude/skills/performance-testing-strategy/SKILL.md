# Performance Testing Strategy Designer

Guides QA engineers through designing a **complete, structured performance testing strategy** by gathering context through targeted questions and applying industry best practices.

**Important:** Always gather context first (Step 1) before producing any output. Do not skip to recommendations without understanding the system and its constraints.

## Output Format

After completing Step 1, deliver a strategy document with these sections:

1. **System Under Test (SUT) summary** — what you understood about the application
2. **Recommended test sequence** — which test types to run and in what order, with rationale
3. **Per-test definition** — for each type: goal, user load, duration, ramp-up, success criteria
4. **Metrics to collect** — response times, throughput, error rates, infrastructure metrics
5. **Risks and prerequisites** — what must be in place before testing starts

---

## Step 1 — Gather Context

Ask only what you don't know yet. Work through these categories; stop when you have enough to design the strategy. **Do not ask all questions at once** — group them naturally and wait for answers before continuing.

### A. Application Profile
- What type of application is it? (web app, mobile backend, microservice, batch job, streaming pipeline)
- What protocol does it use? (HTTP/REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, gRPC, message queue)
- Is it stateful (sessions, auth tokens) or stateless?
- Does it have external dependencies? (third-party APIs, databases, caches, message brokers)
- Does the infrastructure auto-scale, or is capacity fixed?

### B. Traffic and Usage Patterns
- What is the **current or expected peak load**? (requests/second, concurrent users, transactions/day)
- Is traffic **steady** (e.g., internal tool) or **spiky** (e.g., flash sale, marketing campaign, scheduled batch)?
- Are there **known peak windows**? (time of day, day of week, seasonal events)
- What does a **typical user flow** look like? (sequence of actions, not just a single endpoint)

### C. SLAs and Acceptance Criteria
- Is there a **response time target**? (e.g., p95 < 1s, p99 < 2s)
- Is there a **throughput target**? (e.g., must handle 500 RPS)
- What is the **acceptable error rate**? (e.g., < 0.1% errors under load)
- Are SLAs defined per endpoint, globally, or both?

### D. Environment and Constraints
- What **environment** will tests run against? (production-clone, staging, dedicated perf env)
- Is the environment **isolated** from production traffic?
- Are there **data constraints**? (test users, sanitized data, data volume)
- Are there **infrastructure limits** to be aware of? (shared DB, rate limiters, WAF, CDN)
- What is the **available test window**? (hours or days available to run tests)

### E. Scope and Goals
- Is this a **first-time** performance test or a **regression** run before a release?
- Is there a specific **concern or risk** driving this? (new feature, peak event prep, incident post-mortem, capacity planning)
- What **load testing tool** will be used? (ask without suggesting — the strategy is tool-agnostic)

---

## Step 2 — Select Test Types

Recommend only the test types that match the stated goals and risks. **Do not recommend all five by default** — justify each one based on the context gathered.

**Load [references/TEST-TYPES.md](references/TEST-TYPES.md) when the user needs detailed definitions, parameters, and decision criteria for each test type.**

### Quick selection guide

| Situation | Recommended tests |
|---|---|
| First time testing, no baseline | Smoke → Load |
| Pre-release regression check | Smoke → Load |
| Low-risk internal tool (≤ 50 users, no external SLA) | Smoke → Load only — stop here, do not add Stress or Spike |
| Preparing for a peak event (Black Friday, launch) | Smoke → Load → Spike |
| Investigating slowdown under sustained traffic | Smoke → Load → Endurance |
| Finding the system's breaking point | Smoke → Load → Stress |
| Full strategy for a production-grade system | Smoke → Load → Stress → Spike → Endurance |
| Time-constrained (< 4 hours) | Smoke → Load only |

### Sequencing rule
**Always run Smoke first.** Never jump straight to Stress or Spike — a broken baseline wastes time and produces misleading results.

## Step 3 — Define Each Test

For every recommended test type, produce a precise definition. Use the templates below. Express load in **users or RPS** — never in tool-specific syntax.

### Smoke Test
```
Goal:          Verify the test setup works and the system handles minimal load
Users:         2–5 virtual users
Duration:      2–5 minutes
Ramp-up:       None (inject all users at once) or 30 seconds
Success:       0 errors, all responses within 2× the SLA threshold
When to skip:  Never — always run smoke first
```

### Load Test
```
Goal:          Measure behavior under expected production load
Users:         Peak load × 1.0 (baseline) and peak load × 1.2 (safety buffer)
Duration:      30–60 minutes of steady state (after ramp-up)
Ramp-up:       10–20% of total duration (e.g., 10 min ramp for a 60 min test)
Success:       Error rate < 0.1%, p95 within SLA, p99 within 2× SLA
When to skip:  Only if a load test was run recently with no system changes
```

### Stress Test
```
Goal:          Find the maximum load before degradation or failure
Users:         Start at peak load; increase by 20–25% each step until breaking point
Duration:      Until failure or throughput plateaus — typically 30–90 minutes
Ramp-up:       Staircase: add load increments every 5–10 minutes
Success:       Identify the breaking point; confirm graceful degradation and recovery
When to skip:  When the only goal is SLA validation (not capacity exploration)
```

### Spike Test
```
Goal:          Verify behavior during sudden, large traffic bursts
Users:         Baseline load → sudden jump to 2–5× peak → return to baseline
Duration:      10–20 minutes total (the spike itself: 2–5 minutes)
Ramp-up:       Instantaneous spike; gradual recovery back to baseline
Success:       System survives without crashing; recovers to baseline SLA within a defined window
When to skip:  When traffic is inherently steady with no burst patterns
```

### Endurance / Soak Test
```
Goal:          Detect issues that only appear over time: memory leaks, connection exhaustion, resource drift
Users:         70–80% of peak load (sustainable, not maximum)
Duration:      2 hours minimum; 8–24 hours for critical or long-running systems
Ramp-up:       Standard ramp (10–15 min)
Success:       Response times and error rates at the end are within 10% of values at the start of steady state
When to skip:  Short-term regression only — note the risk and schedule a soak test later
```

## Step 4 — Define Metrics

**Load [references/METRICS-AND-SLAS.md](references/METRICS-AND-SLAS.md) when the user asks about which metrics to collect, how to set SLA thresholds, or what to monitor on the infrastructure side.**

### Minimum metrics for every test

**Application-level (collected by the load testing tool):**
- Response time: p50, p90, p95, p99 — never rely on mean alone
- Throughput: requests/second or transactions/second
- Error rate: percentage of failed requests (timeouts + error responses)
- Concurrent users / active sessions over time

**Infrastructure-level (collected via monitoring — APM, metrics platform, cloud dashboards):**
- CPU utilization (investigate if sustained > 70%)
- Memory utilization (watch for upward drift in Endurance tests)
- Network I/O (saturation indicates infrastructure bottleneck, not application bottleneck)
- Database: connection pool usage, slow query rate, lock waits
- Runtime-specific (if applicable): heap usage, garbage collection frequency and pause duration

> **Instruction:** Express all metrics in generic terms — never include runtime-specific flags, API calls, or platform-specific names. Use "heap usage" and "GC pause duration", not `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`, `process.on()`, `HeapInuse`, or any language/runtime syntax. The strategy must remain tool-agnostic throughout Steps 4 and 5.

## Step 5 — Prerequisites Checklist

Before running any test, verify:

- [ ] **Test environment is isolated** — test traffic will not affect real users or production data
- [ ] **Test data is prepared** — realistic volume of users, products, orders, or domain entities
- [ ] **Data strategy is defined** — how test data is consumed: cycled, randomized, or unique per run
- [ ] **Monitoring is active** — metrics collection is running *before* the test starts
- [ ] **Baseline metrics exist** — at minimum, a smoke test result to compare against
- [ ] **Team is available** — someone can monitor and stop the test if needed
- [ ] **Rollback plan exists** — for tests that could cause data corruption or service interruption
- [ ] **Third-party services are stubbed or rate-limited** — avoid generating real charges or hitting partner quotas
- [ ] **Rate limiters / WAF are configured for testing** — or bypassed in the test environment
- [ ] **Alerts are suppressed** — to avoid on-call noise during intentional stress or spike tests

## Common Strategy Mistakes

### 1. Starting with Stress before Load
Running a stress test without a load test baseline means you cannot distinguish "the system breaks at 500 users" from "the system was already broken at 100 users."

### 2. Testing in production without isolation
Even read-only load tests can cause production incidents (DB CPU spikes, cache eviction, rate limiter triggers). Always use an isolated environment.

### 3. Using unrealistic user flows
Testing only a single endpoint (e.g., a health check) tells you nothing about real user behavior. Model the top 2–3 user journeys from analytics or business requirements.

### 4. Ignoring think time between requests
Zero think time between requests generates 10–100× more load than real users produce. Every scenario must include realistic pauses that reflect actual user behavior.

### 5. No infrastructure monitoring
Knowing response times without knowing CPU/memory/DB state means you cannot diagnose *why* the system degraded. Always run infrastructure monitoring in parallel with the load test.

### 6. Short endurance tests
A 5-minute soak test finds nothing. Memory leaks and connection exhaustion typically appear after 30–120 minutes of sustained load. Minimum viable soak: 2 hours.

### 7. Treating test results as absolute truth
Results are only valid for the environment, data volume, and configuration tested. Always document these conditions alongside the results — a test in staging with 10% of production data is not a production capacity test.

### 8. Testing the wrong workload model
Concurrent users and arrival rate (RPS) are not interchangeable. Understand whether your system should be tested with a fixed number of concurrent users (closed model) or a fixed arrival rate of new requests (open model). Using the wrong model produces misleading throughput numbers.
